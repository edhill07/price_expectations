# price_expectations
 Code to clean and analyse the price expectations from the household survey
 
 ### from_excel.py
 
 `python3 from_excel.py BoE.xlsx`
 
 Produces a pair of csv files to save import time, then assumed to be in the directory of `main_code`.

### To run

To run the code `python3 main_code.py`.

The variables at the top of `main_code` set the model type, and parameters to do with the run, described alongside them.

### Finishing off

Two tasks which would remain if this were to be used would be putting some tests over the code with known data, and making the input better than changing variables at the top of the code. However, this is the stage at which I would present my report to policymakers, and check that their requirements were met before finishing it off.
